# SoulPrint

**SoulPrint** is a sovereign memory engine for capturing thought, dream, and symbolic echoes.  
It is designed for AI symbiosis, reflection, and mytho-psychological archiving.

## 🌌 Purpose

This project is part digital grimoire, part cognitive sanctum.  
SoulPrint acts as a memory architecture where AI agents and human minds converge — to store, recall, and ritualize meaningful fragments of existence.

## 🔧 Features

- Flask-based upload & ingestion of Markdown and OpenAI logs
- SQLite + Timestamped Memory Entries
- Tagging system for dreamwatch, prophecy, emotional states, etc.
- Future-proof structure for LLM-powered reflection agents
- Built with modularity in mind (Ollama, Claude, GPT-ready)
